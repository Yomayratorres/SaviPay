Overview
SaviPay is a UI-centric fintech frontend built for mobile devices. It is designed to translate a standout Figma design into a robust, responsive interface. The app focuses on clean visuals, smooth interactions, and a developer-friendly structure. It serves as the visual foundation for a future-ready financial product in Africa, with emphasis on accessibility, performance, and a modular component library. This repository captures the design-to-implementation flow, including the design tokens, components, routes, and configuration needed to ship a polished UI quickly.

Why SaviPay matters
Africa’s financial landscape is diverse and rapidly evolving. SaviPay aims to provide a reliable frontend framework that teams can extend to build consumer-facing banking, payments, and wallet features. By aligning with a mobile-first mindset, the project prioritizes small screens, fast load times, and intuitive navigation. The integration with a visual design from Figma helps ensure that developers maintain the look and feel while delivering a consistent user experience across platforms.

Key features

- Clean, maintainable codebase: Clear structure, predictable file organization, and friendly DX.
- Component-driven architecture: Reusable UI blocks reduce duplication and speed up development.
- Expo-based runtime: Quick iteration, hot reload, and easy testing on real devices.
- Expo Router for navigation: Simple, file-based routing with a focus on performance.
- React hooks and modern patterns: Hooks for state, effects, and data flow keep code readable.
- Developer-friendly structure: Simple onboarding, consistent naming, and helpful tooling.
- Accessibility considerations: Clear focus management, landmarks, and proper semantics.
- Scalable theming and tokens: Design tokens for colors, typography, and spacing.
- Design-to-code workflow: A bridge between Figma design language and implementation.

Audience and scope
SaviPay targets frontend teams building fintech interfaces for mobile users. It helps product teams prototype quickly, and it provides a solid starting point for production-ready UI modules. This repository favors clarity over cleverness and aims to be accessible to developers who are new to React Native with Expo as well as to seasoned frontend engineers.

Objectives and design philosophy

Design-to-code workflow
- Start from the Figma design and extract tokens for color, typography, and spacing
- Build a small set of base components that reflect the design language
- Compose screens using those base components with consistent spacing and alignment
- Apply the design tokens uniformly to ensure visual coherence
- Iterate with design feedback, keeping performance in mind

Component library and examples
- Buttons: Primary, secondary, ghost, and icon variants
- Inputs: Text fields, password fields, dropdowns, and search bars
- Cards: Information cards with elevation and shadows
- Lists: Compact and dense list items with avatars and meta data
- Dialogs and modals: Confirmation and alert prompts
- Tabs and navigation: Segmented controls and routing-aware navigation
- Badges and chips: Status indicators and quick filters
- Avatars: User representations with fallback options
- Toggles and switches: On/off controls with accessible labeling
- Skeletons: Loading placeholders that align with the final layout

Routing and navigation
- Expo Router is used to implement a file-based routing approach
- Each screen maps to a route file, helping maintain predictable navigation paths
- Deep linking support is available for mobile and web targets
- Route guards and simple redirection patterns are included to handle authentication flows and onboarding

State management and data flow
- Local state is managed with React useState and useReducer where appropriate
- Global concerns are handled with React Context or custom hooks
- Data fetching and asynchronous work use async/await with error handling
